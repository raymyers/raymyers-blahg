Hello, welcome. This is a blog ("blahg" is the proper spelling for Chicagoans) template. It's built with [Astro](https://astro.build).

- Update `astro.config.mjs` with your domain
- Edit `src/config.js`
- Add your URL in line 1 of `public/robots.txt`
- Add your links in `src/components/Header.astro`

And finally, please ping me (via social media, or in a GitHub Issue, or whatever) if you use this template! I would love to see your writing and subscribe to your RSS feed!

## Run it yourself

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:

| Command           | Action                                      |
| :---------------- | :------------------------------------------ |
| `npm install`     | Installs dependencies                       |
| `npm run dev`     | Starts local dev server at `localhost:4321`  |
| `npm run build`   | Build your production site to `./dist/`      |
| `npm run preview` | Preview your build locally, before deploying |

**Have fun!**
