Gender, Sex, and Sexual Orientation are categories of identities which have been repeatedly vilified throughout my lifetime in various ways.

When we express acceptance of these groups in various innocuous and undemanding ways such as "let people get married" or "call people their name" or the dreaded "there's tampons in the bathroom" a vocal section of people get quite angry.

What I think is happening here is simply scapegoating. There's no placating the dominant class. No end-game. Never has been.

**The heteros are upsetero**.

But that's not everyone. Some people are genuinely curious and on the fence. Maybe some of the rhetoric sounds reasonable but you can tell something is... off. For those interested, I'll unpack my mental model on some of these topics.

Here it is:

* Chromosomes *mostly* dictate biological sex.
* Biological sex *mostly* dictates sexual orientation.
* Biological sex *mostly* dictates our relationship with gender.
* All these *mostly's* are tenuous and have meaningful exceptions.

Further,

* Our interests are not in conflict.
* We can straightforwardly live together while having diverse identities.
* Failing that, we can leave each other alone.

That is essentially my entire position. Is it clear?

In the remainder I'll discuss what these terms mean in the way I use them.

## Gender

Gender is not biological. Gender is a social and psychological construct. That doesn't make it imaginary or trivial. Other examples of social and psychological constructs are language, laws, mathematics, and property.

Gender is non-binary, meaning it has more that 2 ways of expressing. Gender is fluid, meaning its experience can change over time. It being fluid is not quite the same as being a choice, we cannot directly chose our internal experience, only how we describe and express it. Society's understanding of gender is also fluid over time, especially what we sometimes call our "gender roles".

I experience being a man, but I'd be hard-pressed to explain what exactly that experience is like or if yours is the same. If society expected me to dress and act as a woman it would feel uncomfortable and incorrect. We have terms for when our gender isn't affirmed, like "feeling emasculated". I imagine that's somewhat related to a more severe form of psychological distress called Gender Dysphoria, but I'm not an expert and the psychology is still somewhat mysterious.

It's usually enough to understand that almost all of us have some psychological needs related to our gender, and like all psychology it varies.

# Sex

The trait of sex is biological. It is expressed by roughly 5 kinds of indicators in humans, which usually agree but not always. Some indicators most of us are familiar with are chromosomal, hormonal, external genitalia, and other reproductive organs.

When done on animals, the skill of reading the available indicators is called "sexing", as in "a trained individual can sex a baby chicken with 95% accuracy." When done on humans, this reading is what we'd call things like "assigned male at birth".

Biological sex is non-binary.

It's non-binary because the indicators don't always line up, AND because they don't all have 2 answers. For instance. If you wanted to make this simpler by saying chromosomes should be the sole indicators of sex, you still have many other configurations to account for besides XX, XY. When people's biological sex indicators don't align into the binary, that is sometimes called DSD (Differences in Sex Development). Intersex is an older term that's no longer the technical jargon but still often used to self-identify.

It's estimated DSD represents of the order of 1 in 2,000 people. That's likely been similar throughout all of human history, what's changed is mainly our knowledge of it.

If any of this is news to you, it's probably because it doesn't affect you and it doesn't need to. It's fine to stop at "it's complicated". But to say "Everyone's biological sex is either male or female" is incoherent. It's a generalization of the same kind as "People are always right handed", "Nobody has naturally red hair", or "Hydrogen and Helium are the only two elements in the universe".

Is biological sex fluid? I'm not sure that's a useful distinction. You could take it indicator by indicator. My assumption is that if I had a testosterone deficiency I could get that addressed (would that be "unnatural"?), but if I wanted to change my chromosome that's staying put.

## Orientation

Sexual orientation is an umbrella term about the categories of people we tend to be physically attracted to, and sometimes other details like how and when.

Commonly known orientations include Heterosexual, Homosexual, Bisexual, and Asexual. These have been observed throughout the animal kingdom and human history.

Sexual orientation is a spectrum because people may be attracted outside their main orientation to various degrees. It can be fluid if attraction changes over time, but more often it's stable with the change being how someone describes themself as they learn their needs and grapple with social pressures. Thus, if someone "came out as gay" this does not mean that they "turned gay" at some point. It's more like at some point they came to understand what had always  been different about them, and probably also kept that information hidden for some time due for fear of their communities reaction. Having seen some of those reactions, I find that fear extremely well founded.

The attempt to turn someone from gay to straight is called Conversation Therapy which is a form of torture and has otherwise no effect.

Now, given we've established sex and gender are different, which one does orientation mean attraction to? Probably either/or. We're attracted to people not to categories at the end of the day. People do what they do and call it what they call it. It doesn't matter to me whether a cis persons and a trans person are considered to be in a heterosexual relationship, a homosexual one, both, or neither. That's a question for the couple, if anything.

As an aside, there has been difference of opinion on whether the newer term Pansexual means something different than Bisexual. "Pan" means all, where "Bi" literally means two. However, the "Bi" in Bisexual is arguably just a historical quirk. It was meant to be the inclusive label, not to exclude. I bring this up as an example of intersectionality and the fact that labels are forever in a state of gradual renegotiation.

You'll notice the trend here is that categories are usually imperfect. We need labels to understand the world, but they only go so far.

## Identity

Those terms all get used as descriptors but also identities. Someone's identity is like their evolving description of how they understand themselves. It usually makes sense to take people at their word on what their identity is, because it's a statement about their own self-image. Only they know what's in their mind. The way our identities coexist is like a social lubricant.

As an example of failing to exercise this principle, imagine you said something like:

> Jay-Z's mother isn't a real lesbian, she had a child.

Notice what that does is jump from your descriptor to someone else's identity. Each side of that is based on someone's current understanding, but clearly only one of them has any context or skin in the game.

If we wanted to express that in a way that respects the gap from our descriptor to someone else's identity, we might end up with this meandering inner monologue:

> She doesn't match my understanding of typical lesbian because I thought they never wound up giving birth, there's probably more to that story. It's not really my business though, if she shares I might check it out.

Or as Ben Franklin put it on a coin:

> Mind your business

You are entitled to have whatever internal understanding of these labels, or have no opinion at all. Other people's identity does not depend on your opinion, yours does.

The only time where it would seem justified to argue someone's conception of their own identity would be if someone else's rights are at stake. However for the identities discussed here, it's unlikely for that to genuinely be the case.

# Conclusion

With this understanding, the approach to even highly-contentious issues should be fairly obvious. Forget the click bait. Accept that the distinctions are imperfect. Consider whether they need to carry weight in the first place, and how. When distinctions need to be made, they will naturally be at odds with reality some of the time. Listen to people's needs and use your best judgement.

Reduce harm, respect agency, and don't feed the trolls.
