So Agile Alliance is [Project Management Institute (PMI)](https://www.agilealliance.org/agile-alliance-joins-project-management-institute-pmi/). I don't have a strong opinion on that. I like harmony… some think it’s an abandonment of principles, or that the principles have long been abandoned.

Personally I’m just contemplating how I would describe to the uninitiated this allergy we’ve developed to the word “project”.

In broad strokes:

The [Agile manifesto](https://agilemanifesto.org/principles.html) uses the word “project”. At some later point we decided that even acknowledging the existence of a project was incompatible with iterative development. We moved from trying to do “Agile Project Management” to thinking that was an oxymoron. Naturally there was tension between coaches and people identifying as Project Managers.

This was also related to a push toward “Product Thinking”. There are some good points there: projects end, products live on. I think it overplays our hand to say that products and projects are mutually incompatible but there is tension to manage.

You’ll notice that if you try to remove the word "project" from your speech, other words just spring up in its place. How is that project going, oh right we don’t do projects here… what’s going on with that, um, initiative… milestone… phase…

A way I might say it now is that plans need to be dynamic, which is different from saying we shouldn’t plan. But building trust and shared understanding of goals with the person I’m talking to is more important to than nitpicking vocabulary.
