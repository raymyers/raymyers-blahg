It's that time again! We've got to sprout a new blog and see if it takes hold.

These are some other places where I've written. As you can see there's been a bit of sprawl which we're attempting to consolidate to this new spot.

* [Mender.AI](https://mender.ai/) (AI applications to legacy code)
* [Nopilot.dev](https://nopilot.dev/) (Autonomous DevTools)
* [Ray Myers on LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/cadrlife/)
* [Cadrlife Blogspot](https://cadrlife.blogspot.com/2007/12/how-i-decided-it-was-time-to-get-blog.html) (old)

I also have these outlets which will continue.

* [Craft vs Cruft on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC4nEbAo5xFsOZDk2v0RIGHA)
* [Empathy in Tech podcast](https://empathyintech.com/)
* [raymyers on GitHub](https://github.com/raymyers)

We're trying out Cassidy Willams' [template](https://github.com/cassidoo/blahg), which uses Astro, Netlify, and TinaCMS. At least until the day where you can [blog in a theorem prover](https://github.com/leanprover/verso/tree/main?tab=readme-ov-file).
