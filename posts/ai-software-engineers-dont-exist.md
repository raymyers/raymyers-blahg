There is currently no such thing as an "AI Software Engineer". Similarly, there are no AI Doctors or AI Lawyers.

I now work on AI agents full time, so obviously I feel this is a valuable direction. Still, I feel just as strongly as I did before that it's unethical to exaggerate what's been achieved and ultimately the hype will be self-defeating as early adopters are burnt by broken promises.

If you've like to discuss recent details, I'm easy to reach on LinkedIn. For today, I'll reiterate my position from April 2024 in "[Devin Dissected](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhkY_BUDVcU)".

## What is a Software Engineer?

Software Engineer was a term introduced by Margaret Hamilton for the Apollo Moon landing project in order to secure professional respect for her colleagues and to emphasize the disciplined practices they were developing. By consensus, the term's use in most of the industry remains somewhat aspirational, but with the world now running on software we have good reason to use it carefully.

For discussion's sake, let's consider some basic necessary, though not sufficient conditions. We might all agree that a Software Engineer:

* Is a [professional](https://jolt.law.harvard.edu/assets/articlePDFs/v33/33HarvJLTech557.pdf), having an obligation to uphold a standard of care
  * Therefore, has legal and moral agency typically associated with personhood
* Is capable not only of solving small, predefined tasks in a codebase, but also
  * Creating and maintaining a codebase of significant size over a period of time
  * Partnering to define the requirements to be done

Without the supervision of a human programmer, every autonomous coding tool to date would fail these minimal prerequisites. That's before any consideration of the actual engineering discipline as currently understood, see Dave Farley's recent book [Modern Software Engineering](https://www.davefarley.net?p=352) for a nice formulation.
